Ensures that interfaces between units are correct and that the overall behavior is as expected.
3. System Testing:

Tests the entire software system as a whole.
Verifies that all components interact correctly and meet overall system requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing:

Performed by end-users or stakeholders.
Evaluates whether the software meets their acceptance criteria and is suitable for production use.
Importance of Testing in Software Development:

Testing is crucial in software development because:

Detects and Fixes Defects: Testing identifies errors and bugs early on, preventing them from propagating through the software lifecycle.
Ensures Functionality: Tests verify that the software performs its intended functions according to its specifications.
Increases Reliability: By identifying and addressing defects, testing improves the stability and robustness of the software.
Reduces Maintenance Costs: Early detection of defects can save time and effort in future maintenance and support.
Improves Customer Satisfaction: Well-tested software delivers a better user experience and reduces customer frustration.
Version Control Systems

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that track and manage changes to code files. They allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, ensuring that changes are recorded and conflicts are resolved.

Popular VCS include:

Git: A distributed version control system that allows each developer to have their own local copy of the repository.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system where changes are made to a central repository.
CVS (Concurrent Versions System): A legacy VCS that is still used in some projects.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
